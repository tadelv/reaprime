/// Regression coverage for comms-harden #1 — `setProfile` equality guard.
///
/// The guard short-circuits when `_currentProfile == profile`. Before the
/// fix, `_currentProfile` was assigned **before** `_sendProfile` was
/// awaited, so a mid-upload throw (e.g. a BLE timeout after the header
/// frame but before the tail) poisoned the cache: a retry with the same
/// profile hit the guard and silently no-op'd, leaving the DE1 running
/// on a half-loaded profile with the caller seeing success.
///
/// After the fix, `_currentProfile` is assigned only after `_sendProfile`
/// completes successfully, so a retry with the same profile after a
/// failed upload proceeds with a fresh upload.
///
/// Option C verification: integration test over a real `UnifiedDe1` with
/// a recording `SerialTransport`. Counts `writeCommand` invocations as a
/// proxy for "upload happened".
///
/// See: doc/plans/comms-harden.md #1, doc/plans/comms-phase-0-1.md PR 2.
