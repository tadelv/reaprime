/// A 1-D constant-velocity Kalman filter estimating flow (g/s) from noisy
/// scale weight measurements.
///
/// The filter maintains a 2-element state vector `[weight, flow]` internally,
/// but only the **flow** estimate should be consumed by callers. Raw weight
/// passes through to consumers unfiltered — the Kalman state tracks weight
/// solely to derive a smooth, low-lag flow estimate via the constant-velocity
/// model.
///
/// ## Design
///
/// - **Adaptive measurement noise `R`** — tracked online from innovation
///   (residual) variance with **asymmetric EMA**: transients inflate R slowly
///   (reject noise), recovery deflates R quickly (re-trust sensor fast).
/// - **Fixed process noise `Q`** from flow physics (0–10 g/s, bounded ramp
///   rate). We adapt trust in the sensor, not the physics model.
/// - **Variable `dt`** in every predict step — fixes the count-based window
///   bug of the old [MovingAverage].
/// - **Signed flow** — no `.abs()` (un-breaks the cup-removal branch in
///   [ShotSequencer._refineStoppingYield]).
/// - **Hard re-init at tare** via [reset] — re-seeds weight to current, flow
///   to 0, covariance moderate (the filter re-converges quickly from the new
///   baseline).
///
/// ## Tuning rationale
///
/// These parameters are a middle ground between two extremes. The
/// original filter (R_max=50, P_init=100, Q=2.0) produced smooth flow but
/// a severely laggy *weight* estimate (10s convergence on a 99g test
/// weight, overshooting to 130g). The aggressive retune (R_max=5,
/// P_init=10, Q=4.0) fixed weight convergence but doubled per-sample
/// flow jitter (0.49 vs 0.23 g/s mean |Δflow| at native 10 Hz). Since
/// weight is now raw-passthrough in [ScaleController], R only affects
/// flow smoothness. These values target the smoothest flow that still
/// converges within ~5 samples at native 10 Hz.
///
/// ## Multi-scale
///
/// Adaptive `R` auto-calibrates its baseline to whatever scale's noise floor
/// is connected (no per-scale `R` table). Variable-`dt` handles a slower
/// scale's larger intervals. Two mechanisms, two axes (noise vs rate).
