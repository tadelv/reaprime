/// stream. Shared by `MockBengle`'s integrated scale and the standalone
/// `MockScale` so both read like a real scale under a real shot:
///
/// - Nothing accumulates outside `MachineState.espresso` and
///   `MachineState.hotWater`; espresso preinfusion frames
///   (`profileFrame < targetVolumeCountStart`) are absorbed by the puck,
///   while hot water lands in the cup 1:1.
/// - The basket, screen and spouts hold back the first few mL of every shot
///   ([firstDropsMl]), so weight lags the pour start instead of rising the
///   instant pouring begins.
/// - Extraction ramps in over [saturationSecs] as the basket saturates, so
///   early weight gain is gradual rather than tracking the fill-flow spike.
/// - Once saturated, weight gain tracks flow 1:1 — real DE1 shots show
///   dW/dt of 0.85–1.1x reported flow late in the shot (visualizer.coffee
///   sample set); the absorbed water is a fixed early cost, not a permanent
///   percentage tax.
