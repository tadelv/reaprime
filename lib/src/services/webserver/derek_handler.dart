/// HTTP relay for Derek, the Decent RAG assistant.
///
/// Forwards `POST /api/v1/derek/answers/stream` to Derek's public answer
/// endpoint and pipes the Server-Sent Events response straight back to the
/// caller, unbuffered, so a browser skin can render the answer as it streams.
///
/// Why a relay instead of calling Derek from the browser: Derek's endpoint is
/// auth-less and its server does not answer CORS preflight, so a `POST` with a
/// JSON body (a non-simple request) fails the browser's `OPTIONS` preflight.
/// Routing through Reaprime makes it a same-API call that the existing
/// `corsHeaders` middleware already handles.
///
/// Derek is public knowledge-base data, so this route stays on the API's
/// LAN-trust model — no bearer token — and the request/response are relayed
/// verbatim. Derek owns request validation, rate limiting, and error shapes.
