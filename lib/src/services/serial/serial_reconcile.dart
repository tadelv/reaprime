///    mid-connect frees the native port the connect is using.)

///    self-disconnected: a vanished port also clears suppression + forgets the
///    HDS mark (a replug re-detects fresh); a still-present self-disconnect is
///    suppressed so the timer reconcile doesn't churn it (reap→re-probe→
///    reconnect). A still-present, connected device is kept.

/// `suppressAdd` wins over `suppressRemove` (a present self-disconnected HDS
/// reaped in a liveness pass ends up suppressed), matching the original
