# AI Build Notes

Read this when building, running, flashing, or touching platform configuration. Skip it for pure Dart/logic changes that don't touch native code or build tooling.

## Common Commands

Prefer `./flutter_with_commit.sh` for all runs — it injects the git commit hash and respects `.env.dev`. Pass `--dart-define` flags through it.

```bash
# Run
./flutter_with_commit.sh run                                    # Standard
./flutter_with_commit.sh run --dart-define=simulate=1           # All simulated
./flutter_with_commit.sh run --dart-define=simulate=machine,scale

# Test & Lint
flutter test                                   # All tests
flutter test test/path/to_test.dart            # Specific file
flutter test --name "test pattern"             # Specific test
flutter analyze                                # Static analysis
dart format lib/ test/                      # Format

# Build (Linux via Docker/Colima)
make build-arm                                 # ARM64 binary
make build-amd                                 # x86_64 binary
make dual-build                                # Both architectures
```

## Simulate Modes

Simulated devices avoid hardware requirements for smoke testing. Available types:

| Flag value | Devices |
|------------|---------|
| `1` | All: `MockDe1`, `MockScale`, `MockBengle`, `MockSensor` |
| `machine` | `MockDe1` only |
| `scale` | `MockScale` only |
| `bengle` | `MockBengle` only |
| `machine,scale` | `MockDe1` + `MockScale` |
| `sensor` | `MockSensor` only |
| `0` | None (debug routes on, real hardware) |

Also toggleable from the settings UI after launch.

### Espresso replay (MockDe1)

When a shot starts, `MockDe1` replays a real recorded shot instead of
synthesizing telemetry — mirroring de1app's simulate mode. The corpus is
de1app's three `simulations/*.shot` files, converted to native historical-shot
JSON under `assets/simulations/` (source `.shot` files live in
`tool/simulation_sources/`). `SimulatedShotLibrary` loads them; `MockDe1` picks
one at random per shot and streams its samples on the wall-clock timeline via
`ShotReplayer`, dropping to idle when the recording ends. The simulated scale
weight follows for free — `MockScale` integrates the machine's (now recorded)
flow.

Replay is on by default and falls back to the parametric synthetic model when
no corpus is available (`MockDe1(replayHistoricalShots: false)`, or no library
injected — e.g. a bare `MockDe1()` in unit tests). To rebuild the corpus after
editing the sources: `REGEN_SIM_ASSETS=1 flutter test
test/tools/generate_simulation_assets_test.dart`.

### `simulate=0` mode

`--dart-define=simulate=0` enables the debug infrastructure (API routes,
no-Firebase, no-telemetry) while creating zero simulated devices. Use it for
temporary real-hardware tuning builds where debug endpoints must be reachable.

- Enables debug REST routes (`/api/v1/debug/*`)
- Creates no simulated devices — all BLE/USB hardware is real
- Disables Firebase and telemetry
- Must not be used for production releases

## Platform Config

**Supported platforms:** Android (primary), macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS.

- `flutter_with_commit.sh` injects the git commit hash as a compile-time constant via `--dart-define`.
- CI uses pinned Flutter version. Linux build smoke runs via Docker.
- Android uses `ForegroundTaskService` for background BLE. Auto-stops 5min after disconnect; auto-restarts on reconnect.
- `Makefile` targets: `build-arm`, `build-amd`, `dual-build` (Linux only, requires Docker/Colima).

## Footgun #1: Xcode 26.4 / flutter_inappwebview

**Symptom:** `flutter build macos` fails with `Swift 6.3 error: protocol 'ASWebAuthenticationPresentationContextProviding' requires 'presentationAnchor(for:)' to be available in macOS 10.14 and newer`.

**Root cause:** Upstream `flutter_inappwebview_macos` plugin bug — `presentationAnchor(for:)` annotated `@available(macOS 10.15, *)`, narrower than the protocol requirement (10.14). Swift 6.3 promotes this from warning to hard error. Xcode 26.3 still builds fine.

**Fix:** `dependency_override` in `pubspec.yaml` pointing to fork `wangqiang1588/flutter_inappwebview` (commit `fc33a449`). Upstream PR #2809 is open but unreviewed (3+ months).

**Impact:** Blocks local macOS smoke-testing only. CI (Linux) and Android builds unaffected.

**Track:** Remove override once upstream #2809 merges + plugin release ships.

## Footgun #2: Serial Probe Write Hang

**Symptom:** Windows startup freezes when a non-Decent USB-serial device sits on a COM port.

**Root cause (fixed PR #241):** Serial discovery probes every port with MMR writes; `write(timeout:0)` blocked forever + unbounded `drain()` froze the main isolate in native FFI. Dart `.timeout()` couldn't fire.

**Fix:** Finite 500ms per-chunk write timeout + bail on zero-progress, `drainWithTimeout` polling `bytesToWrite`.

## Footgun #3: `codesign --deep` destroys Sparkle's Installer XPC

**Symptom:** After a signed/notarized update, Sparkle's "Update failed" alert or a silent failure to relaunch. The app builds and notarizes fine.

**Root cause:** `codesign --deep --force --entitlements <host.plist>` re-signs every nested binary (Sparkle.framework, Installer.xpc, Updater.app, Autoupdate) with the HOST's entitlements. The sandboxed Installer XPC service needs its own embedded entitlements; clobbering them breaks the sandbox escape that replaces the app in `/Applications`. Sparkle explicitly warns against `--deep`.

**Fix:** `scripts/sign_macos_deepest_first.sh` signs Sparkle's nested helpers deepest-first (`Installer.xpc` → `Downloader.xpc` → `Updater.app` → `Autoupdate` → framework → host), each without `--entitlements` so existing embedded entitlements survive; only the host app gets `Release.entitlements`. Gates in `scripts/verify_macos_signature.sh` (Team ID, Hardened Runtime, mach-lookup names, no `get-task-allow`) run before and after notarization.

## Footgun #4: `codesign` does not expand `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`

**Symptom:** The signed app's entitlements contain the literal string `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)-spks`, so Sparkle's XPC lookup fails (the XPC registers as `net.tadel.reaprime-spks`).

**Root cause:** `codesign --entitlements` takes the file as-is; Xcode build-variable expansion happens only in Xcode's own signing step. The signing script sed-expands the bundle id before signing (see `scripts/sign_macos_deepest_first.sh`).

**Fix:** Never hand `Release.entitlements` to `codesign` unexpanded. The verification script also greps for the unexpanded variable.

**Note (App Store):** `com.apple.security.temporary-exception.mach-lookup.global-name` is not permitted in Mac App Store builds. Any future `APP_STORE=true` macOS build must drop the Sparkle keys/entitlements and keep self-update disabled.

## CLI Parameters

The app supports several command-line flags for headless/calibration-station use. See PR #349 and #352 for full details.

```bash
./flutter_with_commit.sh run --dart-define=simulate=1 \
  --serial=<mac>              # Auto-connect to specific DE1 by MAC
  --bypass-onboarding         # Skip onboarding, go straight to launcher
  --direct                    # Skip scan, connect directly to --serial device
  --skin=<id>                 # Pre-select skin by ID
  --skin-path=<path>          # Pre-select skin by filesystem path
  --no-account                # Skip DecentAccountService (headless Linux with no desktop session)
```

All flags are optional. Combine as needed. `--no-account` is specifically for headless Linux stations where `libsecret` blocks on XDG secrets portal.

## Dev-Loop Skill

Driving a running app through its lifecycle: `.agents/skills/decent-app/SKILL.md`. Managed by `scripts/sb-dev.sh`:

```bash
scripts/sb-dev.sh start      # Launch in simulate mode
scripts/sb-dev.sh reload     # Hot reload (preserves state)
scripts/sb-dev.sh hot-restart  # Full restart (resets state)
scripts/sb-dev.sh stop       # Kill the app
scripts/sb-dev.sh logs       # Tail logs
scripts/sb-dev.sh status     # Is it running?
```

Prefer `reload` over `hot-restart` — state is preserved.

## Logging

- Dart-side: `package:logging`, configured in `main.dart`.
- File log: `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()/log.txt` (plus rotated `log.txt.1..3`).
- Android retrieval: `adb shell run-as net.tadel.reaprime cat app_flutter/log.txt` or `adb logcat`.

## Focused Checks

```sh
flutter analyze          # Minimum before any commit
flutter test             # Full suite before commit/PR
dart format lib/ test/  # Format check
```

## Keeping Notes Fresh

Add build footguns, platform-specific quirks, and toolchain issues that would save debugging time. Prune when upstream fixes ship. Prefer fewer, sharper notes over long background.
