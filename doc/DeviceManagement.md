## Architecture Overview

REA uses a layered architecture for device management:

```

**Key Principles:**
- **Transport Abstraction:** Devices depend on injected transport interfaces, not concrete implementations
- **Constructor Dependency Injection:** All dependencies passed through constructors
- **Single Responsibility:** Each layer has a clear, focused purpose
- **Reactive Streams:** RxDart BehaviorSubjects for state broadcasting

---

## Discovery Services

Discovery services are responsible for scanning and creating device instances. Each service handles a specific transport type.

### Available Services

#### 1. UniversalBleDiscoveryService
- **Platform:** All (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **Package:** `universal_ble` (native backends on mobile/Windows/macOS; pure-Dart BlueZ backend on Linux)
- **File:** `lib/src/services/universal_ble_discovery_service.dart`
- **Discovery:** Unfiltered BLE scan + name-based matching (`DeviceMatcher`); also queries system/bonded devices (`getSystemDevices`) for CoreBluetooth/BlueZ. Single BLE stack on every platform since the flutter_blue_plus → universal_ble consolidation (see `doc/plans/archive/ble-universal-ble-migration/`).
- **Linux/BlueZ note:** `UniversalBleTransport` applies BlueZ-specific connect handling on `Platform.isLinux` (stop scan + settle before connect to avoid `le-connection-abort-by-local`, post-connect settle, `discoverServices` retry) — without it the DE1 cold connect fails with "Failed to resolve services".

#### 2. SerialService
- **Platform:** Desktop (macOS, Linux, Windows), Android (USB OTG)
- **Files:**
  - `lib/src/services/serial/serial_service_desktop.dart` (desktop)
  - `lib/src/services/serial/serial_service_android.dart` (Android)
  - `lib/src/services/serial/serial_service.dart` (factory)
- **Discovery:** Enumerates serial ports, probes for device identification

  DE1-family detection is layered:
  1. `productName == "DE1"` → `UnifiedDe1`. `productName == "Bengle"` →
     `Bengle`. Cheapest path.
  2. VID:PID match against `lib/src/services/serial/usb_ids.dart`.
     Tables empty until concrete pairs are captured from hardware.
  3. Fallback: open the port, send `<+M>` and the v13Model MMR-read
     request, wait for `[M]` (DE1-protocol baseline) plus an `[E]…`
     reply at addr `0x0080000C`. v13Model `>= 128` → `Bengle`, else
     `UnifiedDe1`. Encoded via `lib/src/services/serial/mmr_codec.dart`.

#### 3. SimulatedDeviceService
- **Platform:** All
- **File:** `lib/src/services/simulated_device_service.dart`
- **Purpose:** Testing without physical hardware
- **Activation:** Set `simulate=1` compile-time variable or enable in settings

#### 4. WifiScaleDiscoveryService
- **Platform:** All (Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux)
- **Files:**
  - `lib/src/services/wifi/wifi_scale_discovery_service.dart` (service + `WifiScaleBrowser`/`WifiManualEndpointStore` seams + `WifiScaleEndpoint`)
  - `lib/src/services/wifi/bonsoir_wifi_scale_browser.dart` (bonsoir-backed mDNS browser + shared_preferences manual store)
  - `lib/src/services/wifi/wifi_ip_cache.dart` (resolve-once IP cache)
  - `lib/src/models/device/impl/decent_scale/scale_wifi.dart` (`HDSWifi` scale)
  - `lib/src/models/device/impl/decent_scale/hds_wifi_protocol.dart` (JSON frame parser + command strings)
  - `lib/src/models/device/transport/web_socket_transport.dart` (`WebSocketTransport` / `WsTransport`)
- **Purpose:** Discover and connect the WiFi **Half Decent Scale** (HDS) — the same hardware reachable over BLE (`DecentScale`) and USB (`HDSSerial`), but over WiFi it speaks **JSON over a WebSocket**, not the binary BLE/serial protocol. Motivation: free the BLE radio for the machine, removing scale↔machine BLE contention (helps weak-BT tablets).
- **Discovery:** DNS-SD (mDNS) via bonsoir — browses `_decentscale._tcp`, resolves the host (`hds.local`) + IPv4, connects to `ws://<ip>:80/snapshot`. Native on every platform (NsdManager / Bonjour / Avahi / dns_sd), so **no app-managed `MulticastLock`** is needed on Android.
- **Manual fallback:** A host (IP or name) can be added manually (`addManualEndpoint`), persisted via `shared_preferences`, and is always re-emitted on startup for auto-reconnect. This is the universal fallback when discovery is unavailable — e.g. **Linux without the Avahi daemon**, locked-down networks, or any mDNS failure.
- **Identity:** A WiFi scale is its own device, `deviceId = "wifi:<host>"`, distinct from the BLE/USB identities of the same physical scale (the same scale may appear as up to three entries; the user picks one).
- **Reliability:** `HDSWifi` owns a connect handshake (`rate 10k` → `events on` → `status`), an **HDS-recognition gate** (not reported `connected` until a `grams`/`status` frame proves the endpoint is a scale), and a **snapshot watchdog** (a silent stall with the socket still open emits `disconnected`). It runs **no reconnect loop of its own** — like the BLE/USB scales, a drop is reported by emitting `disconnected`, and `ConnectionManager`'s preferred-scale reconnect owns re-connection (one reconnect policy for all transports). On reconnect the discovery service rebuilds the transport against the cached IP first (`WifiIpCache`), re-resolving only on failure — honoring the firmware's resolve-once / prefer-IPv4 guidance. Presence in the device list is **reachability-driven**: a discovered scale is probed (TCP connect to `:80`) and hidden after repeated failures, re-surfaced when its IP answers again — so mDNS flakiness can't flicker the list.
- **Construction:** Like the USB HDS path, the service constructs `HDSWifi` **directly**, bypassing the BLE-coupled `DeviceMatcher`.
- **Platform config:** iOS/macOS `Info.plist` declare `NSBonjourServices` (`_decentscale._tcp`) + `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` (without these, Apple silently returns no results); macOS already grants the `com.apple.security.network.client` entitlement. Linux discovery requires the **Avahi daemon** running; otherwise use manual entry.

### Device Matching

Discovery services use name-based matching via `DeviceMatcher` to create appropriate device instances from BLE advertisement names:

**File:** `lib/src/services/device_matcher.dart`

**Key Points:**
- Unfiltered BLE scans — no service UUID filtering
- `DeviceMatcher.match()` takes a transport and advertised name, returns a `Device?`
- Name rules map advertisement names to device factories
- Service verification happens during `onConnect()` using `BleServiceIdentifier`
- DiFluid R2 reflectometers are matched separately from DiFluid scales by advertised name and the R2 BLE service UUID, then exposed as `Sensor` devices with a `measure` command

### Service Lifecycle

1. **Initialization:** `service.initialize()`
   - Set up platform-specific scanning
   - Initialize internal state
   - Start listening to platform events

2. **Scanning:** `service.scanForDevices()`
   - Start platform-specific scan
   - Match discovered devices to mappings
   - Create device instances via factories
   - Emit devices via stream

3. **Device Stream:** `service.devices`
   - Broadcast stream of discovered devices
   - Updates when new devices found or existing devices disconnect

---

## Device Controller

**File:** `lib/src/controllers/device_controller.dart`

The DeviceController is the central coordinator for all device discovery services.

### Responsibilities

1. **Service Coordination:**
   - Manages multiple discovery services
   - Subscribes to each service's device stream
   - Merges devices from all services into unified stream

2. **Device Lifecycle:**
   - Tracks discovered devices
   - Removes disconnected devices on scan (allows re-discovery with fresh transport)
   - Prevents duplicate device entries

3. **Scan Management:**
   - Exposes `scanningStream` for scan lifecycle tracking
   - Coordinates parallel scans across all discovery services
   - Suppresses disconnect/reconnect detection during active scans — intermediate device list changes are transient noise. Genuine disconnects outside of scans are still detected.

**Note:** DeviceController does **not** handle connection policy. All connection decisions (which device to connect, when to connect) are handled by `ConnectionManager`.

### Key Methods

```dart
// Initialize all services
Future<void> initialize() async {
  for (var service in _services) {
    await service.initialize();
    _serviceSubscriptions.add(
      service.devices.listen((devices) => _serviceUpdate(service, devices))
    );
  }
}

// Trigger scan across all services
Future<void> scanForDevices() async {
  _scanningStream.add(true);
  // Scan all services in parallel
  await Future.wait(_services.map((s) => s.scanForDevices()));
  _scanningStream.add(false);
}
```

### Device Stream

The unified device stream combines all devices from all services:

```dart
Stream<List<Device>> get deviceStream => _deviceStream.asBroadcastStream();

List<Device> get devices => 
  _devices.values.fold(List<Device>.empty(growable: true), (res, el) {
    res.addAll(el);
    return res;
  }).toList();
```

## Connection Manager

**File:** `lib/src/controllers/connection_manager.dart`

The ConnectionManager is the centralized orchestrator for all device connection decisions. It replaces the previously scattered auto-connect logic that was spread across DeviceController, ScaleController, and De1StateManager.

### Connection Status

ConnectionManager exposes a `ConnectionStatus` stream driven by the
`ConnectionPhase` enum.

- **`idle`:** No connection activity
- **`scanning`:** BLE/USB scan in progress
- **`connectingMachine`:** Connecting to a DE1 machine
- **`connectingScale`:** Connecting to a scale
- **`ready`:** All requested devices connected

The status also tracks:
- `foundMachines` / `foundScales` — devices discovered during the last scan
- `pendingAmbiguity` — `machinePicker` or `scalePicker` when the UI needs to show a device selection dialog
- `error` — error message from the last connection attempt

#### Phase transitions

All phase writes route through `StatusPublisher.publish`. If a
transition isn't listed below, it's not supposed to happen.

Transition owners (where the `publish(phase: …)` call lives):

| Edge                                    | Owner                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `idle → connectingMachine` (QC)         | `ConnectionManager._connectImpl` (before QC attempt)    |
| `connectingMachine → ready` (QC)        | `ConnectionManager._connectImpl` (after machine adoption)|
| `connectingMachine → scanning` (QC fail)| `ScanOrchestrator.runScan` (QC returned null)            |
| `idle → scanning`                       | `ScanOrchestrator.runScan`                              |
| `scanning → idle` (scan failure)        | `ScanOrchestrator._emitScanStartError`                  |
| `scanning → connectingMachine`          | `ConnectionManager.connectMachine` (policy stage)       |
| `connectingMachine → connectingScale`   | `ConnectionManager.connectScale` (post-machine policy)  |
| `connectingMachine → ready` (no scale)  | `ConnectionManager._finalizePhase`                      |
| `connectingScale → ready`               | `ConnectionManager._finalizePhase`                      |
| `connectingScale → idle` (scale error)  | `StatusPublisher.emitError` → gatekeeper folds to idle  |
| any `→ idle` on disconnect              | `DisconnectSupervisor._onMachineGone / _onScaleGone`    |

`scaleOnly` reconnects (`connect(scaleOnly: true)`) skip every machine-phase
edge and go `idle → scanning → connectingScale → ready`.

Non-phase status fields (`error`, `foundMachines`, `pendingAmbiguity`)
are allowed to change on any edge; only the `phase` field follows the
table above.

### Connection Policy

When `connect()` is called:

1. **Scan** for all devices via `DeviceController.scanForDevices()`
2. **Early connect** — if preferred device IDs are set in settings, connect as soon as they appear during scan (don't wait for scan to finish)
3. **Machine phase** — apply preferred machine policy:
   - Preferred set + found → auto-connect
   - Preferred set + not found, but others available → show picker (`machinePicker`)
   - No preferred, 1 machine → auto-connect
   - No preferred, multiple → show picker (`machinePicker`)
4. **Scale phase** — apply preferred scale policy (same logic as machine)

**Early stop.** With a preferred machine set, the scan stops as soon as
its targets connect rather than running the full timeout: when a preferred
scale is also configured, only once *both* connect; when no preferred scale
is configured, as soon as the machine connects. In the no-preferred-scale
case a scale that advertises just after that stop would be missed, so a
deferred (fire-and-forget) scale-only rescan is armed ~3s later — the
machine is already usable and the scale connects in the background if one
shows up. The delay mirrors the post-wake reconnect (lets the DE1 BLE link
stabilise). The rescan is armed only when the scan was actually cut short,
so a full scan that ran to completion never triggers one.

### Key Methods

- `connect()` — Full scan + connect flow (machine + scale)
- `scanAndConnectScale()` — Scale-only reconnect (skips machine phase)
- `connectMachine(De1Interface)` — Connect to a specific machine
- `connectScale(Scale)` — Connect to a specific scale
- `disconnectMachine()` / `disconnectScale()` — Explicit disconnects

### Disconnect Handling

ConnectionManager listens for disconnects automatically:
- Watches `de1Controller.de1` stream — `null` means machine disconnected
- Watches `scaleController.connectionState` — resets `_scaleConnected` flag on disconnect
- Resets phase to `idle` when machine disconnects

### Machine Auto-Reconnect (recovery mode)

An *unexpected* machine disconnect (not announced via
`markExpectingDisconnect` / `disconnectMachine`) puts `ConnectionManager`
into machine recovery mode: full `connect()` scans retry with the same
5s→60s exponential backoff the preferred-scale loop uses, rescheduling
after every attempt that ends without a machine, until the machine
reconnects (or the user disconnects deliberately). Gated on
`preferredMachineId` so a background retry can never pop a machine picker —
the id is auto-set on every successful connect, so coverage is effectively
total. Motivation: a power outage previously left the app "disconnected"
indefinitely because nothing ever rescanned for the machine.

### Zombie-Link Detection (BLE transport)

A dead BLE link doesn't always deliver a disconnect event (observed on
Android: GATT writes time out forever while the app still believes it is
connected, and no recovery is possible without an app restart).
`UniversalBleTransport` detects this and emits `disconnected` itself —
which drives the normal disconnect cascade and, for machines, the
auto-reconnect above:

- **On a GATT operation timeout** it probes the OS connection state
  (async, never blocking the caller). An OS-confirmed drop declares the
  link dead; three consecutive timeouts force a teardown even if the OS
  still claims connected. A single timeout on a healthy link keeps the
  existing fail-fast behavior (profile-upload safety — see the comment on
  `UniversalBleTransport.write`).
- **On seeing its own deviceId advertising** while believed connected, it
  runs the same probe (throttled). Teardown is probe-confirmed only,
  because the transport is shared with scales/sensors and some peripherals
  legitimately advertise while connected.

### Gone-Device GATT Error Handling (BLE transport)

When a BLE write/read/subscribe hits a device that has already
 disconnected (scale powered off mid-session, Bluetooth adapter off on
 macOS, DE1 unplugged), `universal_ble` throws `UniversalBleException`
with error codes like `characteristicNotFound`, `deviceNotFound`,
`serviceNotFound`, `connectionTerminated`, `deviceDisconnected`, or
`unknownError`. The transport's `_handleGattError()` catches these,

1. Emits `ConnectionState.disconnected` (drives the normal disconnect cascade),
2. Drains the BLE queue (`clearQueue`) so pending writes don't pile up, and
3. Throws `DeviceNotConnectedException` so upper layers handle it gracefully
   instead of crashing.

GATT error 133 (`gattError`) is treated as transient — the queue is cleared
and a `BleTimeoutException` is thrown so `UnifiedDe1Transport` can retry via
`_handleBleTimeout`. The link is NOT declared dead for GATT-133.

### Crashlytics Error Filtering (telemetry)

The `DeviceNotConnectedException` thrown from `_handleGattError` and the raw
`UniversalBleException` can escape to the Flutter framework's global error
handlers (`FlutterError.onError`, `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError`)
from fire-and-forget contexts — e.g. a `Timer.periodic` heartbeat callback
where nobody is awaiting the write Future. Without filtering, the
Crashlytics integration records these as FATAL crashes (false positives —
the transport already emitted `disconnected` and the device impl's
connectionState listener handles cleanup).

`isBenignFrameworkError()` in `lib/src/services/telemetry/crashlytics_error_filter.dart`
filters these from both framework error handlers:

- `DeviceNotConnectedException` (any kind)
- `UniversalBleException` with gone-device error codes
- `Exception('Queue Cancelled')` — from `universal_ble`'s `Queue.dispose()`
  when `clearQueue` cancels pending items

This is the safety net. Device implementations should ALSO catch
`DeviceNotConnectedException` at their write level for graceful recovery
(see [Best Practices](#best-practices)).

### Preferred Device Settings

Device preferences are stored via `SettingsController`:
- `preferredMachineId` — auto-set on successful machine connection
- `preferredScaleId` — auto-set on successful scale connection
- Configurable in Settings → Device Management

---

## Device-Specific Controllers

Device-specific controllers manage the lifecycle and state of individual device types. They handle the low-level connection mechanics; the ConnectionManager handles the policy of *when* and *which* device to connect.

### De1Controller

**File:** `lib/src/controllers/de1_controller.dart`

**Responsibilities:**
- Manages DE1 connection (manual, user-selected)
- Exposes machine state streams
- Handles steam/hot water/flush settings
- Manages shot settings and profile uploads

**Connection Flow:**
```dart
Future<void> connectToDe1(De1Interface de1Interface) async {
  _onDisconnect(); // Clean up any existing connection
  _de1 = de1Interface;
  await de1Interface.onConnect();
  _de1Controller.add(_de1);
  
  // Subscribe to machine streams
  _subscriptions.add(_de1.ready.listen(_initializeData));
  _subscriptions.add(_de1.connectionState.listen(_processConnection));
}
```

**Key Streams:**
- `de1`: Current connected DE1 (or null)
- `steamData`: Steam settings
- `hotWaterData`: Hot water settings
- `rinseData`: Flush/rinse settings

### ScaleController

**File:** `lib/src/controllers/scale_controller.dart`

**Responsibilities:**
- Manages scale connection lifecycle (called by ConnectionManager)
- Processes weight and flow data
- Calculates smoothed weight flow
- Exposes weight snapshots and connection state

**Note:** ScaleController does **not** auto-connect. Connection decisions are made by `ConnectionManager`. ScaleController only handles the mechanics of connecting to a specific scale.

**Connection Flow:**
```dart
Future<void> connectToScale(Scale scale) async {
  _onDisconnect();
  _scaleConnection = scale.connectionState.listen(_processConnection);
  _scaleSnapshot = scale.currentSnapshot.listen(_processSnapshot);
  await scale.onConnect();
  _scale = scale;
}
```

**Key Streams:**
- `connectionState`: Scale connection status (`BehaviorSubject<ConnectionState>`)
- `weightSnapshot`: Processed weight data with flow calculation
- `currentConnectionState`: Synchronous getter for current state

### SensorController

**File:** `lib/src/controllers/sensor_controller.dart`

**Responsibilities:**
- Manages sensor connections (basket sensors, debug port)
- Auto-connects to first found sensor
- Exposes sensor data streams

**Pattern:** Mirrors ScaleController auto-connect logic

DiFluid R2 reflectometers use the standard `Sensor` abstraction. After the
sensor is connected, skins can call the `measure` command through the existing
Sensors API and read TDS, temperature, refractive index, and status values from
the sensor data stream.

### RememberedDevicesController

**File:** `lib/src/controllers/remembered_devices_controller.dart`

Persists devices the user has connected to (machine + scale) so they stay
visible — marked **unavailable** — when they're not currently present, instead
of vanishing. Cross-transport (BLE/USB/WiFi) by construction.

- **Registry:** `{id, name, type}` per device, persisted as a JSON list in the
  settings layer (`SettingsService.rememberedDevices`), mirroring the
  preferred-device persistence pattern. Loaded on `initialize()`.
- **Observation:** consumes two `Stream<RememberedDevice?>` (machine, scale);
  `main.dart` wires these from `De1Controller.de1` and
  `ScaleController.connectionState` (+ `connectedScale()`), reading
  `{id, name, type}` off the connected device. A null emission (disconnect)
  does **not** forget — the device stays remembered.
- **Availability:** computed at the API layer. `DevicesStateAggregator` /
  `DevicesHandler` merge live devices (`available: true`) with remembered
  devices that aren't present (`available: false`, `state: "disconnected"`) via
  the shared `buildAvailabilityDeviceList`. The aggregator re-emits when the
  registry changes. `DeviceController` itself stays live-only.
- **Forget:** `RememberedDevicesController.forget(id)`, exposed as
  `PUT /api/v1/devices/forget` (deviceId in body/query). A GUI Forget control
  lives in the web skin (separate repo), driven by this endpoint.
- **Identity:** by `deviceId`, stable per transport (BLE MAC, WiFi `wifi:<host>`,
  serial USB stable id or — on macOS where vid/pid is unreadable — the port
  path). Moving a USB device to a different physical port yields a new id (new
  remembered entry); Forget removes the stale one.

### Bengle integrated scale

When a Bengle is the connected machine, its integrated scale is auto-attached
to `ScaleController` as a virtual `BengleVirtualScale`. The integrated scale
always wins on Bengle: external scale scanning is skipped entirely, and
`preferredScaleId` is ignored while a Bengle is connected. Multi-scale
support (external scale alongside the integrated scale) is on the roadmap.

Capability discovery: `GET /api/v1/machine/capabilities` includes
`"integratedScale"` when a Bengle is connected. Skins should use this flag
to gate "internal scale" UX hints.

---

## Connection Flow

### Quick Connect

Before running a full scan, `ConnectionManager._connectImpl` tries a
**machine-only quick-connect** — a direct connection to the preferred machine
from remembered-device metadata, without scanning:

```
ConnectionManager._connectImpl()
  |
  +-- Publish connectingMachine phase (UI shows spinner, not Retry)
  |
  +-- Look up preferred machine in RememberedDevicesController
  |

  |
  +-- If machine null -> fall through to ScanOrchestrator.runScan()
       (existing scan -> match -> EarlyConnectWatcher -> connect)
```

Scales are **excluded** from quick-connect. The machine-only critical path
publishes ready immediately after machine adoption, then kicks off background
scale discovery:

- **Preferred scale configured:** `_maybeSchedulePreferredScaleReconnect()`
  (exponential backoff: 5s → 10s → 20s → 40s → 60s cap)
- **No preferred scale:** `_armPostQuickConnectScaleScan()` (single deferred
  scale-only scan after ~3s, same delay as the post-wake reconnect)

Quick-connect is tried in **all** connect cycles (startup, manual
reconnect, recovery mode). The phase stream shows
`idle → connectingMachine → ready` on success. On failure:
`connectingMachine` is published before the attempt, then phase falls
through to `scanning` (existing scan path).

### Initial App Startup

```
1. main.dart
   ↓
2. Create discovery services with device mappings
   ↓
3. Create DeviceController(services), De1Controller, ScaleController
   ↓
4. Create RememberedDevicesController, initialize (loads + migrates registry)
   ↓
5. Create ConnectionManager(deviceController, de1Controller, scaleController,
   settingsController, rememberedDevices)
   ↓
6. runApp(MyApp(...))
   ↓
7. OnboardingView displayed (steps: android-warning → welcome → login →
   permissions → initialization → scan)
   ↓
8. Permissions step grants permissions; initialization step runs
   deviceController.initialize()
   ↓
9. Scan step calls connectionManager.connect()
   ↓
10. ConnectionManager: machine-only quick-connect (preferred machine)
     -> publish connectingMachine -> BLE/serial tryQuickConnect ->
     adoptDevice -> Bengle virtual scale / deferred scale scan ->
     publish ready. On failure: fall through to full scan.
   ↓
11. Status stream (QC success): idle -> connectingMachine -> ready.
     Status stream (QC failure): idle -> connectingMachine -> scanning ->
     connectingMachine -> connectingScale -> ready.
     ↓
12. On `ready`, onboarding completes -> navigates to LauncherView, then pushes
    SkinView on top when the platform supports an in-app WebView, the device
    isn't a degraded Android (SDK < 31), and the skin server is serving.
    Degraded/unsupported devices stay on the launcher (browser hero card).
```

If multiple machines or scales are found without a preferred device set, ConnectionManager emits `pendingAmbiguity: machinePicker` or `scalePicker`, and the UI shows a picker dialog.

### Scale Reconnect from StatusTile (legacy home_feature)

> **Note:** This tap-to-reconnect affordance lives in the legacy `home_feature`
> StatusTile. Since the native UI redesign, `LauncherView` (not `home_feature`)
> is the default post-onboarding screen. When no machine is connected, the
> launcher shows a **"Connect your machine"** hero card above the skin slot
> that pushes a full-screen scan page (`LauncherScanPage`) reusing the
> onboarding scan flow. Tapping it triggers `connectionManager.connect()`.

```
1. User taps "Scale" text in StatusTile (when no scale connected)
   ↓
2. connectionManager.scanAndConnectScale()
   ↓
3. BLE scan runs, preferred scale policy applied
   ↓
4. If multiple scales found → scalePicker dialog shown
```

### Machine Wake → Scale Reconnect Flow

```
1. Machine state: sleeping → idle
   ↓
2. De1StateManager._handleScalePowerManagement() detects transition
   ↓
3. Check if scale connected → NO, scalePowerMode == disconnect → YES
   ↓
4. Call connectionManager.scanAndConnectScale()
   ↓
5. Scan runs, preferred scale connected automatically
```

## State Management

### Device Connection States

**Enum:** `ConnectionState` (defined in `lib/src/models/device/device.dart`)

```dart
enum ConnectionState {
  discovered,
  connecting,
  connected,
  disconnecting,
  disconnected,
}
```

**Lifecycle:** `discovered → connecting → connected → disconnecting → disconnected`

- `discovered` — device created by discovery service, never connected
- `connecting` — connection in progress
- `connected` — connection established
- `disconnecting` — disconnection in progress
- `disconnected` — was connected, connection lost or explicitly closed

### State Transitions

**Devices:**
```
discovered → connecting → connected → disconnecting → disconnected
```

**Controllers:**
- Subscribe to device `connectionState` stream
- Update internal state on transitions
- Clean up resources on disconnect

### De1StateManager Integration

**File:** `lib/src/controllers/de1_state_manager.dart`

The De1StateManager is the central orchestrator for machine state changes and related behaviors:

**Responsibilities:**
1. Listen to machine state transitions
2. Manage scale power based on state transitions
3. Handle gateway mode logic (full/tracking/disabled)
4. Trigger device scans when needed
5. Manage shot tracking in tracking mode
6. Navigate to realtime features in disabled mode

**Dependencies:**
```dart
De1StateManager({
  required De1Controller de1Controller,
  required DeviceController deviceController,
  required ScaleController scaleController,
  required WorkflowController workflowController,
  required PersistenceController persistenceController,
  required SettingsController settingsController,
  required GlobalKey<NavigatorState> navigatorKey,
})
```

**Key Methods:**
- `_handleSnapshot(MachineSnapshot)`: Processes all machine state updates
- `_handleScalePowerManagement(MachineState)`: Manages scale sleep/wake/scan
- `_triggerScaleScan()`: Initiates device scan with 30s timeout

### Hot water stop-at-weight

**Files:** `lib/src/controllers/hot_water_sequencer.dart` (wiring),
`lib/src/controllers/hot_water_stop.dart` (pure decision logic).

`HotWaterSequencer` is a long-lived service (created once in `main.dart`,
alongside `SteamSequencer`) that brings the espresso stop-at-weight behaviour to
hot water.

Hot water is always started **externally** here (group-head controller, physical
button, REST `PUT /api/v1/machine/state/hotWater`, or a skin) — the native UI
never calls `requestState(MachineState.hotWater)`. So the sequencer *reacts* to
the machine entering `hotWater`:

1. **Arm + tare.** If `stopHotWaterAtWeight` is on, a scale is connected, the
   gateway mode is not `full`, and the configured hot-water `volume` (treated as
   grams) is positive, the scale is tared via `ScaleController.tare()` and the
   monitor arms.
2. **Monitor.** The tare is trusted only once the scale has actually been
   *observed* to drop near zero (proof the tare applied) — guarding against a
   stale pre-tare reading (e.g. a mug still on the platter) causing a false
   early stop. If the tare never lands, the monitor simply never arms and the
   machine's native stop takes over (fail-safe). Once confirmed and past the
   settle window, the weight is projected a short time ahead
   (`weight + weightFlow * hotWaterFlowMultiplier`, default 0.3 s lookahead) —
   the same shape as `ShotSequencer`'s espresso stop-at-weight, but with its own
   multiplier because hot water dispenses with a different pump/flow profile than
   espresso.
3. **Stop.** When the projection reaches the target, `requestState(idle)` is sent
   once. The machine's own volume/time stop is left **unmodified** as a backstop
   (so the no-scale and weight-never-climbs cases still end normally).
4. **Disarm** when the machine leaves `hotWater`, disconnects, or the scale drops.

In `full` gateway mode the sequencer stays inert — a skin owns the machine and
would otherwise double-stop (mirrors `ShotSequencer`'s `bypassSAW`). Controlled
by the `stopHotWaterAtWeight` setting (default `true`, exposed on
`/api/v1/settings`).

## Connection Policy

All connection decisions are centralized in `ConnectionManager`. Individual controllers (De1Controller, ScaleController) only handle the mechanics of connecting/disconnecting.

### Preferred Device Policy

ConnectionManager uses `SettingsController` to read preferred device IDs:

1. **Preferred device set + found during scan** → auto-connect immediately (early connect during scan)
2. **Preferred device set + not found, but others available** → show picker dialog
3. **No preferred device, 1 found** → auto-connect silently
4. **No preferred device, multiple found** → show picker dialog
5. **No devices found** → stay idle

Preferred device IDs are auto-saved on successful connection and can be managed in Settings → Device Management.

### Machine vs Scale Connection

- **Machine** connects first, then scale phase runs
- **Scale failures are non-blocking** — if scale connection fails, machine stays connected and phase stays `ready`
- **Scale-only reconnect** — `scanAndConnectScale()` skips the machine phase entirely (used by De1StateManager for wake-from-sleep and by StatusTile for manual reconnect)

---

## Error Surfacing

BLE errors (connect failures, mid-session disconnects, adapter-level problems) emit on `ConnectionManager.status` as a structured `ConnectionError`. The error appears on `ws/v1/devices` as `connectionStatus.error`. See [`doc/Api.md`](Api.md) and [`doc/Skins.md`](Skins.md#handling-connection-errors) for the taxonomy and skin contract.

When wiring a new app-initiated disconnect call site, precede the disconnect with `ConnectionManager.markExpectingDisconnect(deviceId)` so the resulting disconnect event doesn't fire a `scaleDisconnected` / `machineDisconnected` error. A 10s TTL safety timer clears stale expectations if the disconnect event never arrives.

---

## Adding New Devices

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Define Device Interface

Create an interface in `lib/src/models/device/`:

```dart
// Example: New temperature sensor
abstract class TemperatureSensor implements Device {
  Stream<double> get temperature;
  Future<void> setTargetTemperature(double temp);
}
```

#### 2. Implement Concrete Device

Create implementation in `lib/src/models/device/impl/`:

```dart
class AcaiaTemperatureSensor implements TemperatureSensor {
  final BLETransport _transport;
  
  static const String serviceUUID = "ACAIA-TEMP-SERVICE-UUID";
  
  AcaiaTemperatureSensor({required BLETransport transport})
    : _transport = transport;
  
  @override
  Future<void> onConnect() async {
    // Subscribe to BLE characteristics
  }
  
  @override
  Future<void> disconnect() async {
    // Clean up subscriptions
  }
  
  // ... implement temperature methods
}
```

#### 3. Add Device Mapping

Update `main.dart`:

```dart
services.add(
  UniversalBleDiscoveryService(
    mappings: {
      // ... existing mappings
      AcaiaTemperatureSensor.serviceUUID.toUpperCase(): (t) async {
        return AcaiaTemperatureSensor(transport: t);
      },
    },
  ),
);
```

#### 4. Create Controller (Optional)

If device requires specialized logic, create controller:

```dart
class TemperatureController {
  TemperatureSensor? _sensor;

  /// Called by ConnectionManager when a sensor should be connected.
  Future<void> connectToSensor(TemperatureSensor sensor) async {
    _sensor = sensor;
    await sensor.onConnect();
    // ... subscribe to streams
  }

  void dispose() {
    // ... cancel subscriptions
  }
}
```

**Note:** Connection decisions (when to connect, which device) should be handled by `ConnectionManager`, not by the device-specific controller.

#### 5. Add API Handler (Optional)

Create handler in `lib/src/services/webserver/`:

```dart
class TemperatureHandler {
  final TemperatureController _controller;
  
  void addRoutes(ShelfPlus app) {
    app.get('/api/v1/temperature', () async {
      final temp = await _controller.getCurrentTemperature();
      return {'temperature': temp};
    });
  }
}
```

#### 6. Update OpenAPI Documentation

Add endpoints to `assets/api/rest_v1.yml` and `websocket_v1.yml`.

## Best Practices

### Transport Abstraction

Always depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations:

```dart
// ✅ Good
class MyDevice implements Device {
  final BLETransport _transport;
  
  MyDevice({required BLETransport transport}) : _transport = transport;
}

// ❌ Bad
class MyDevice implements Device {
  final UniversalBleTransport _transport; // Coupled to specific implementation
  
  MyDevice({required UniversalBleTransport transport}) : _transport = transport;
}
```

### Stream Cleanup

Always cancel subscriptions in `dispose()` methods:

```dart
class MyController {
  StreamSubscription<Device>? _deviceSubscription;
  
  MyController() {
    _deviceSubscription = deviceStream.listen(...);
  }
  
  void dispose() {
    _deviceSubscription?.cancel();
    _deviceSubscription = null;
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

Use `catchError` for non-critical operations:

```dart
// Scale power management - don't crash if scale disconnected
scale.sleepDisplay().catchError((e) {
  _logger.warning('Failed to sleep scale display: $e');
});
```

Use `try-catch` for critical operations:

```dart
// Device connection - need to handle error gracefully
try {
  await device.onConnect();
} catch (e) {
  _logger.severe('Failed to connect to device', e);
  // Show user error message
}
```

**Scale writes must catch `DeviceNotConnectedException`.** When a BLE
write hits a disconnected device, the transport's `_handleGattError`
throws `DeviceNotConnectedException`. This can escape from fire-and-forget
contexts (Timer.periodic heartbeat callbacks, unawaited Futures) and reach
the framework error handler. Catch it at the lowest-level write helper so all
command paths are covered:

```dart
// ✅ Good — single catch point in _writeCommand / _safeWrite
Future<void> _writeCommand(List<int> commandBytes) async {
  try {
    await _device.write(serviceId, charId, _buildCommand(commandBytes));
  } on DeviceNotConnectedException {
    // Transport already emitted disconnected; the connectionState
    // listener handles cleanup.
  }
}
```

```dart
// ❌ Bad — bare _transport.write() without catch; crashes if scale
// disconnected mid-session
Future<void> tare() async {
  await _transport.write(serviceId, charId, Uint8List.fromList([0x10]));
}
```

The framework error handler filter (`isBenignFrameworkError`) is the safety
net — but scale-level catches are defense-in-depth and keep the log trace
informative (`.info` level rather than silently swallowed).

### State Broadcasting

Use `BehaviorSubject` for stateful streams:

```dart
final BehaviorSubject<ConnectionState> _connectionController =
  BehaviorSubject.seeded(ConnectionState.discovered);

Stream<ConnectionState> get connectionState => _connectionController.stream;
```

### Initialization Order

Controllers must be created before state managers:

```dart
// main.dart
final deviceController = DeviceController(services);
final de1Controller = De1Controller(controller: deviceController);
final scaleController = ScaleController(controller: deviceController);

// app.dart
final stateManager = De1StateManager(
  deviceController: deviceController,
  de1Controller: de1Controller,
  scaleController: scaleController,
  // ...
);
```

---

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Detailed Logging

Set log level in settings UI or SharedPreferences:

```dart
// Settings → Log Level → FINEST
Logger.root.level = Level.FINEST;
```

Logs are written to:
- **All platforms:** `<app_documents>/log.txt`

### Inspect Device Stream

Add temporary logging in DeviceController:

```dart
_deviceStream.listen((devices) {
  _log.info('Current devices: ${devices.map((d) => d.name).join(", ")}');
});
```

### Check ConnectionManager Status

Monitor connection phases via WebSocket or logs:

```dart
// Subscribe to ConnectionManager status
connectionManager.status.listen((status) {
  _log.info('Phase: ${status.phase}, ambiguity: ${status.pendingAmbiguity}');
});
```

Or via the `/ws/v1/devices` WebSocket — the `connectionStatus` field shows the current phase, found devices, and any pending ambiguity.

### Monitor State Transitions

Add logging in De1StateManager:

```dart
void _handleSnapshot(MachineSnapshot snapshot) {
  _logger.info('State transition: $_previousMachineState → ${snapshot.state.state}');
  // ... state handling
}
```

### Simulated Devices

Use simulated devices for testing without hardware:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=simulate=1              # Simulate all devices
flutter run --dart-define=simulate=machine         # Simulate DE1 only
flutter run --dart-define=simulate=bengle          # Simulate Bengle only
flutter run --dart-define=simulate=machine,scale   # Simulate DE1 and scale
```

Supported types: `machine` (DE1), `bengle`, `scale`, `sensor` (comma-separated).

`simulate=1` enables every type, so it surfaces both `MockDe1` and
`MockBengle` simultaneously — `ConnectionManager`'s preferred-device
policy picks one. For deterministic behavior in tests / CI prefer the
explicit comma-separated form.

Or toggle in Settings UI → Simulated Devices

## Common Issues

### Scale Doesn't Connect

**Symptoms:** Scale found during scan but doesn't connect

**Possible Causes:**
1. Preferred scale ID is set but doesn't match any found scale
2. Another scale already connected (`_scaleConnected` flag)
3. Scale UUID not matched by `DeviceMatcher`
4. BLE permissions not granted
5. Stale device objects in `UniversalBleDiscoveryService._devices` list (should be purged on each scan)

**Debug Steps:**
- Check ConnectionManager logs: `ConnectionManager` logger at `fine` level
- Check `preferredScaleId` in settings: GET `/api/v1/settings`
- Check WebSocket `/ws/v1/devices` for `connectionStatus.pendingAmbiguity`

### Multiple Scans Interfere

**Symptoms:** Devices disappear/reappear during scan

**Cause:** Multiple overlapping scans (BLE stack limitation)

**Solution:** Use `_isScanning` flag pattern:

```dart
bool _isScanning = false;

Future<void> scan() async {
  if (_isScanning) {
    _log.info('Scan already in progress');
    return;
  }
  _isScanning = true;
  try {
    await actualScan();
  } finally {
    _isScanning = false;
  }
}
```

### DE1 Auto-Connects (Unexpected)

**Symptoms:** DE1 connects without user selection

**Cause:** ConnectionManager auto-connects when only 1 machine is found, or when a preferred machine ID is set in settings

**Fix:** Clear the preferred machine ID in Settings → Device Management, or check `ConnectionManager` logs for the connection policy decision

### Serial Devices Not Found

**Symptoms:** Serial scales/machines not discovered

**Platform-Specific Issues:**
- **Desktop:** Check `libserialport` package is included
- **Android:** Enable USB debugging, check USB permissions
- **macOS:** Grant serial port access in System Preferences

**Debug:**
```dart
// In SerialService.scanForDevices()
final ports = SerialPort.availablePorts;
_log.info('Found serial ports: $ports');
```
