# AI BLE Notes

Read this when changing BLE transport, scanning, connection lifecycle, GATT error handling, or transport abstractions. Skip it for pure REST/WS, UI, profile, or plugin changes.

## Source Of Truth

- Transport interfaces: `lib/src/models/device/data_transport.dart`, `lib/src/models/device/ble_transport.dart`.
- BLE transport: `lib/src/services/ble/universal_ble_transport.dart` (cross-platform via `universal_ble` package).
- Connection orchestration: `lib/src/controllers/connection/connection_manager.dart`.
- Device discovery + matching: `lib/src/services/device_matcher.dart`, `lib/src/services/device_discovery/`.
- Error filtering: `lib/src/services/crashlytics_error_filter.dart`.

## Hard Rules

- Never import 3rd-party BLE libraries (e.g. `universal_ble`) outside `lib/src/services/ble/`. Wrap library-specific types (errors, events) in domain types at the transport boundary.
- All BLE operations use 128-bit UUID format for maximum platform compatibility.
- Throttle rapid characteristic reads to avoid overwhelming the Bluetooth stack.
- Always cancel stream subscriptions in `dispose()` methods.
- Scale write paths must catch `DeviceNotConnectedException` at their lowest-level write helper so the exception doesn't escape from fire-and-forget Timer callbacks.

## Transport Architecture

The single BLE transport is `UniversalBleTransport` in `lib/src/services/ble/universal_ble_transport.dart`, wrapping the `universal_ble` package. It implements the `DataTransport` interface: `connect()`, `disconnect()`, `dispose()`, `read(uuid)`, `write(uuid, data)`, `writeWithResponse(uuid, data)`, `subscribe(uuid)`, `connectionState` stream.

`UnifiedDe1Transport` wraps `UniversalBleTransport` and adds MMR read/write on top of raw characteristic I/O. It provides `rawData` stream, `readMmr()`, `writeMmr()`, and typed connection guards (`DeviceNotConnectedException.machine()` on read/write when disconnected).

## Connection Flow

`ConnectionManager` supports three distinct connection intents, selected via
`ConnectionAttemptPolicy`:

### automatic `connect()`

Used by startup, machine recovery, and USB-attach recovery. Tries
remembered-machine quick-connect first. If that fails, scans for devices.
During the scan, preferred machines and scales are connected as they appear
(`connectPreferredDuringScan: true`). The scan stops early once all
preferences are satisfied (`stopScanAfterPreferredConnect: true`).
Preferred-scale watch and deferred scale scan handle the wake-after-connect
race.

### explicit `scanAndConnect()`

Used by the launcher scan page, REST/WS scan commands (when `connect=true`),
and explicit retry buttons. Completes full discovery before policy runs
(`connectPreferredDuringScan: false`), never quick-connects, and never
stops early. Preserves occupied machine/scale slots. When discovery
produces ambiguity (multiple candidates for an unoccupied slot),
a `ConnectionSelectionSession` holds the immutable scan snapshot.
`selectMachine()` and `selectScale()` continue the session against the
session-owned canonical candidates — no new scan fires.

### `scaleOnly` / scale recovery

Triggered by the background scale watch, deferred scale scan, and queued
scale-only reconnect callers. Skips the machine phase entirely — a scale
can connect independently of the machine. If a selection session is active
with pending ambiguity, scale recovery is deferred to avoid racing with
the user's choice. Scales powered off while the machine is sleeping are
skipped to respect the radio-disconnect power mode. On Android, uses a
filtered scan to bypass background throttling.

### Phase lifecycle

`StatusPublisher` drives the `ConnectionStatus` stream with phases:
`idle` → `scanning` → `connectingMachine` → `connectingScale` → `ready`.

Errors transit through the status-publisher gatekeeper: transient errors
(most `ConnectionErrorKind` values) are stripped when the phase moves
into a clearing phase (`connectingMachine`, `connectingScale`, `ready`).
Sticky errors (`scanFailed`, `bluetoothPermissionDenied`) survive
transitions.

### Slot policy

Machine and scale are independently fillable. Occupied slots are never
replaced automatically by a scan. A missing slot auto-connects its
preferred device when found. Without a preferred ID, exactly one candidate
auto-connects; more than one produces ambiguity.

### Cancellation and superseding

`cancelActiveScan()` bumps the generation token, stops the scanner,
cancels any active selection session, discards any queued explicit
replacement, and clears pending ambiguity. An in-flight `_connectImpl`
detects the generation mismatch after `runScan` returns and skips policy.
`cancelSelectionSession()` finalises an already-completed scan as cancelled
without touching an in-flight scan.

Repeated explicit scan requests ("ReScan", stale-scan recovery, repeated
REST/UI calls) supersede the active scan and coalesce into a single
queued replacement. The superseded scan emits one cancelled report; the
replacement emits its normal report. If `cancelActiveScan()` fires while
a replacement is queued, the replacement is discarded and its waiting
callers complete cleanly.

Cancel (launcher) and route-back interception both route through
`cancelActiveScan()`. "View found devices" intentionally stops discovery
and proceeds with partial results — that is a different action, not
cancellation.

## Footgun #1: GATT-133 on Cold Boot

**Symptom:** `Unknown Error 133` on first connect after app restart. Second scan/connect succeeds normally.

**Root cause:** Android BLE stack (`BluetoothGatt.gattStatus = 133 = GATT_ERROR`) busy during connect init. Not a device problem — the `connect()` call itself fails before any characteristic I/O.

**Fix pattern:** `EarlyConnectWatcher` already retries; the 2nd attempt succeeds.

**Status:** The early-connect watcher handles this. Not a code bug — an Android BLE stack behavior.

## Footgun #2: Listener Stacking on Reconnect

**Symptom:** Duplicate WebSocket state messages, `currentSnapshot` emits duplicates.

**Root cause (fixed in PR #246):** `UnifiedDe1Transport.connect()` re-ran `_bleConnect()` → re-`subscribe()`d all characteristics without disconnecting first. `cancelWhenDisconnected` never fired, so listeners stacked → every notification delivered twice.

**Fix:** `CharSubscriptions` helper (cancel-before-replace per characteristic UUID). Unit-tested.

**Verification:** Cannot reproduce in unit/simulate. Rely on Crashlytics + `DuplicateBleSubscription` telemetry to confirm the path fires.

## Footgun #3: USB Charger Dedup

**Symptom:** `BatteryController` writing `setUsbChargerMode` every 60s unconditionally (~2665 writes/2 days).

**Root cause:** DE1 FW re-enables the charger on its own. The periodic write only matters while discharging.

**Fix (PR #246):** `shouldWriteChargerMode()` in `charging_logic.dart`: write-on-change, re-assert "off" every 5min while discharging, skip otherwise. Reset last-applied on disconnect.

## Gone-Device Error Handling

`UniversalBleTransport._handleGattError()` catches `UniversalBleException` with gone-device codes:
`characteristicNotFound`, `deviceNotFound`, `serviceNotFound`, `connectionTerminated`, `deviceDisconnected`, `unknownError`.

On hit: emits `disconnected`, drains the queue, throws `DeviceNotConnectedException`.

The `isBenignFrameworkError()` filter in `crashlytics_error_filter.dart` suppresses these from `FlutterError.onError` — but scale-level catches at the write helper are defense-in-depth.

## BLE Scanning

- Device discovery uses unfiltered scans with name-based matching (`DeviceMatcher`).
- Service verification during `onConnect()` via `BleServiceIdentifier`.
- `ScanStateGuardian` guards against overlapping scans and tracks adapter state.
- `ScanOrchestrator` manages single-scan lifecycle.

## Comms-Layer Patterns

Three reusable idioms from the comms-harden effort:

1. **Tracked-latest over `Rx.combineLatest`** — for single-writer derived state, capture each stream's latest value into a field and route everything through one `_computeStatus()` method. Avoids hidden reentrancy.

2. **Queue-with-coalesce** for concurrent ops of the same kind — one shared `Completer`, drain in the `finally` of the in-flight op (see `scaleOnly` reconnect in `ConnectionManager`). Cleaner than mutex + retry.

3. **Generation token + cancellable Timer/Completer** for debounce-across-disconnect races — bump the generation in the disconnect path, capture it in the debounce closure, bail if it changed when the timer fires (see `De1Controller._shotSettingsDebounce`).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First place to look |
|---------|---------------------|
| GATT-133 on first connect, works on retry | `EarlyConnectWatcher` — 2nd attempt should succeed. |
| Duplicate state messages | Listener stacking. Check `CharSubscriptions` is cancel-before-replace. |
| Scale write exceptions escaping to framework | Scale write path missing `DeviceNotConnectedException` catch. Add at `_writeCommand` / `_safeWrite`. |
| BLE scan overlaps | `ScanStateGuardian` — check adapter state tracking. |
| `TimeoutException` in `universal_ble/queue.dart` | May relate to zombie-link (#431) or concurrent BLE write contention (#423). |
| `PlatformException: Location services required` | Android location permissions not granted. Onboarding check or troubleshooting wizard (#125/#126). |

## Android USB Attach Recovery

`SerialServiceAndroid` implements the optional `DeviceAttachNotifier`
capability. Attach events are non-replaying hints and may carry incomplete
metadata; serial scanning and detection remain the support filter. Android can
broadcast attach before the CDC interface is usable, so
`AttachReconnectCoordinator` coalesces bursts and waits a configurable 500 ms
before invoking the normal connection policy.

Only a missing preferred machine enables this path. The attempt therefore uses
remembered-device quick-connect first, retains scan fallback, and cannot open a
picker when no preference exists. If the immediate attempt finds nothing or
fails, the coordinator explicitly re-arms normal machine recovery. BLE, Wi-Fi,
simulated-device, and scale-only behavior do not expose attach events.

## Quick Connect

`tryQuickConnect` on `UniversalBleDiscoveryService` connects to a known
device by ID without scanning. GATT-133 (cold-boot Android, Teclast) is
handled by a single retry with a 1s delay inside `_connectWithRetry`:

```
await device.onConnect().timeout(10s)
  catch BleConnectException:
    wait 1s
    disconnect
    await device.onConnect().timeout(10s)  // one retry only
```

If both attempts fail, `tryQuickConnect` returns null and the scan fallback
runs. The `EarlyConnectWatcher` does its own retry during the scan.

On Apple (iOS/macOS), `getSystemDevices` is used to find the peripheral in
the system cache. If not cached, returns null immediately (no timeout waste).
On Android/Linux/Windows, direct `UniversalBle.connect(deviceId)` works.

The identity check happens during `onConnect()` — for machines, `v13Model`
is read and compared against the expected `DeviceImplementation`.

## Focused Tests

```sh
flutter test test/services/ble/
flutter test test/controllers/connection/
```

## Profile Upload Safety

### Firmware Latch: ProfileDownloadInProgress

The DE1 firmware sets `ProfileDownloadInProgress` on header write and clears it
on tail write + flash commit. If the upload dies mid-sequence (GATT timeout,
connection drop), the latch stays set indefinitely. While latched:
- The machine silently ignores all start requests.
- The group-head LED pulses magenta (~2 Hz).
- The only recovery is a complete profile upload.

### Two Cache Layers

| Cache | Location | Cleared on | Effect |
|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| Sync `_lastPushedProfile` | `WorkflowDeviceSync` | Disconnect, upload failure | Prevents redundant uploads within one connection |
| Device `_currentProfile` | `UnifiedDe1` | Every `onConnect()`, every upload start | Prevents redundant uploads within one device session |

Both must be cleared on connection edges. The sync cache is cleared by
`_onDe1Change(null)` which runs on disconnect. The device cache is cleared
in `UnifiedDe1.onConnect()` before the `_info` guard.

### Startup Ordering

The on-connect profile push is triggered by `De1Controller.initSettled`, which
fires after machine readiness + startup defaults complete. This replaces the
single-shot `_setDe1Defaults` path whose failures were swallowed.

Generation tokens in both `De1Controller` (`_connectionGeneration`) and
`WorkflowDeviceSync` (`_generation`) guard against stale init completions
from a disconnected generation.

## Keeping Notes Fresh

Add lessons that would have saved debugging time: new footguns, thread-safety constraints, connection-lifecycle changes, non-obvious symptoms, and cross-transport dependencies. Prune stale claims. Prefer fewer, sharper notes over long background.
