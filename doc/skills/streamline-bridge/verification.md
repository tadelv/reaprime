# Verification

Deciding how to smoke-test a change to Streamline Bridge, and the concrete recipes for each workflow. For the broader test-tier decision process (unit / integration / MCP) see `.claude/skills/tdd-workflow/SKILL.md` — this file is specifically about end-to-end verification against a running Streamline Bridge instance driven by `scripts/sb-dev.sh`.

## When to verify via a running app

- **Unit / widget tests** — pure logic, single controller, model, DAO, handler. No BLE, no transport. Run with `flutter test`.
- **Integration tests in-tree** — multi-component flows that mock only the transport edge (`TestScale`, `MockDeviceDiscoveryService`, in-memory Drift). Still `flutter test`; they live alongside unit tests in `test/`.
- **End-to-end verification (this file)** — the feature only exists as a side effect of a running app: REST endpoints, WebSocket streams, plugin runtime, skin webview, hardware-like flows. That's what `sb-dev` + `curl` + `websocat` is for.

## Generic smoke-test recipe

```bash
scripts/sb-dev.sh start --connect-machine MockDe1
scripts/sb-dev.sh status
curl -sf http://localhost:8080/api/v1/machine/state | jq .
# exercise the feature ...
scripts/sb-dev.sh reload
curl -sf http://localhost:8080/api/v1/machine/state | jq .
scripts/sb-dev.sh logs -n 30 --filter error
scripts/sb-dev.sh stop
```

Boot the app with a mock machine connected, confirm REST is reachable and a DE1 is actually connected (`status`), hit the thing you changed, hot-reload the Dart source so the next curl sees the new code, re-exercise, skim the tail of the log for errors, then shut down cleanly. When in doubt about which restart level you need, read `lifecycle.md`.

## Added a new REST endpoint

1. Implement the handler under `lib/src/services/webserver/` and register its route — see `CLAUDE.md` → "Adding a New API Endpoint".
2. `scripts/sb-dev.sh reload` to pick up the change.
3. `curl -sf` the new endpoint and confirm the response shape.
4. **Update `assets/api/rest_v1.yml` in the same commit as the handler change.** Stale spec = stale agent knowledge — future `rest.md` users read the spec, not your handler.
5. Update `doc/Api.md` if the change is user-facing.

## Changed a WebSocket message shape

1. Implement the change.
2. `scripts/sb-dev.sh reload`.
3. One-shot verify against the affected channel:
   ```bash
   websocat --no-async-stdio -n -U -t --max-messages-rev 3 \
     ws://localhost:8080/ws/v1/machine/snapshot | jq .
   ```
   Adjust the channel URL to match what you touched. See `websocket.md` for what each flag does.
4. **Update `assets/api/websocket_v1.yml` in the same commit as the handler change.**
5. Update `doc/Api.md` and/or `doc/Plugins.md` if events or event shapes changed.

## Modified an existing endpoint or stream

Shortest loop: reload, re-hit the endpoint, diff the response against the spec. If the shape changed, update `assets/api/rest_v1.yml` or `assets/api/websocket_v1.yml` in the same commit, and update `doc/Api.md` / `doc/Plugins.md` if user-facing.

## Pre-PR checklist

Before opening a PR, merging locally, or calling work done:

- Plans moved from `doc/plans/` to `doc/plans/archive/<meaningful-subfolder>/`.
- Docs updated for any behavior change that touches them: `doc/Api.md`, `doc/Skins.md`, `doc/Plugins.md`, `doc/Profiles.md`, `doc/DeviceManagement.md`.
- `flutter analyze` clean.
- `flutter test` green.
- Full sb-dev smoke completed: `start` → `status` → exercise feature → `reload` → re-exercise → `stop`.

## Stale spec, stale skill

The skill only works because `assets/api/rest_v1.yml` and `assets/api/websocket_v1.yml` are authoritative. `rest.md` and `websocket.md` both tell readers to trust the spec over their own guesses; future agents generate code from those specs. Any API-shape change that ships without a matching spec update is a regression in the skill itself — the next agent will produce broken code against the wrong contract. This is load-bearing. Update the spec in the same commit as the handler. No exceptions.
